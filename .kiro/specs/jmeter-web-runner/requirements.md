# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a web-based JMeter test execution system. The system allows users to upload JMeter JMX test files, execute them on the server, and view or download the generated test reports.

## Glossary

- **Web_Application**: The web-based interface for managing JMeter tests
- **JMeter_Engine**: The server-side JMeter execution component
- **Test_File**: A JMeter JMX format test configuration file
- **Test_Report**: The output generated by JMeter after test execution
- **User**: A person interacting with the web application
- **Test_Execution**: A single run of a JMeter test file

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Upload Test Files

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload JMeter JMX files through the web interface, so that I can prepare tests for execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a file with .jmx extension, THE Web_Application SHALL accept the upload
2. WHEN a user attempts to upload a non-JMX file, THE Web_Application SHALL reject the upload and display an error message
3. WHEN a file upload completes successfully, THE Web_Application SHALL display confirmation with the file name
4. WHEN a file upload fails, THE Web_Application SHALL display a descriptive error message
5. THE Web_Application SHALL validate that uploaded files are valid XML format

### Requirement 2: Execute JMeter Tests

**User Story:** As a user, I want to trigger JMeter test execution on the server, so that I can run performance tests without local setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers execution for an uploaded test file, THE JMeter_Engine SHALL start the test execution
2. WHEN a test execution is in progress, THE Web_Application SHALL display the current execution status
3. WHEN a test execution completes successfully, THE Web_Application SHALL notify the user
4. IF a test execution fails, THEN THE JMeter_Engine SHALL capture the error details and THE Web_Application SHALL display them
5. THE JMeter_Engine SHALL generate standard JMeter reports upon test completion

### Requirement 3: View Test Reports

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view test reports in the browser, so that I can quickly analyze test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test execution completes, THE Web_Application SHALL display a link to view the report
2. WHEN a user clicks to view a report, THE Web_Application SHALL render the report content in the browser
3. THE Web_Application SHALL display report metadata including test name, execution time, and status
4. WHEN viewing a report, THE Web_Application SHALL present key metrics in a readable format
5. THE Web_Application SHALL support viewing multiple reports from different test executions

### Requirement 4: Download Test Reports

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download test reports, so that I can share results or perform offline analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test execution completes, THE Web_Application SHALL provide a download option for the report
2. WHEN a user initiates a download, THE Web_Application SHALL serve the complete report package
3. THE Web_Application SHALL package reports in a standard archive format (ZIP or TAR)
4. THE Web_Application SHALL include all report artifacts (HTML, CSV, logs) in the download
5. WHEN a download completes, THE Web_Application SHALL maintain the report on the server for future access

### Requirement 5: Manage Test Files

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my uploaded test files, so that I can manage and reuse them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_Application SHALL display a list of all uploaded test files
2. WHEN displaying test files, THE Web_Application SHALL show file name, upload date, and size
3. WHEN a user selects a test file, THE Web_Application SHALL provide options to execute or delete it
4. WHEN a user deletes a test file, THE Web_Application SHALL remove it from storage and update the list
5. THE Web_Application SHALL persist uploaded files across server restarts

### Requirement 6: Handle Concurrent Executions

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle multiple concurrent test executions, so that multiple users can run tests simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple test executions are requested, THE JMeter_Engine SHALL queue them appropriately
2. THE JMeter_Engine SHALL support configurable concurrent execution limits
3. WHEN a test is queued, THE Web_Application SHALL display its queue position
4. WHEN execution capacity becomes available, THE JMeter_Engine SHALL automatically start queued tests
5. THE Web_Application SHALL display the status of all active and queued executions
